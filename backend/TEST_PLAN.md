# Test Plan for Issue #13: Add Hello World Endpoint

## Overview
This test plan covers the implementation of a new GET endpoint `/api/hello` that returns `{"message": "Hello World"}`.

## Test Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Location**: `tests/unit/routes/hello.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Test handler function returns correct JSON structure
  - Test handler returns correct status code (200)
  - Test handler response content matches expected message

### 2. Integration Tests
- **Location**: `tests/integration/api/hello.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Test endpoint accessibility via HTTP GET request
  - Test response headers (Content-Type: application/json)
  - Test response body structure and content
  - Test endpoint behavior with different HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE should return 404 or 405)
  - Test rate limiting behavior when configured

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/hello-endpoint.test.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Full request-response cycle from client perspective
  - Test endpoint availability when server is running
  - Test CORS headers are properly set
  - Test endpoint performance (response time)
  - Test concurrent requests handling

## Test Implementation Approach
All tests are created with stub implementations that will fail initially. The actual endpoint implementation will be provided by another developer to make the tests pass.

## Expected Test Results
- All tests should run but fail initially (red phase of TDD)
- Tests should provide clear failure messages indicating missing implementation
- No compilation or lint errors should occur

## Success Criteria
- Tests cover all aspects of the endpoint functionality
- Tests are isolated and independent
- Tests follow Jest best practices
- Tests provide good documentation of expected behavior
