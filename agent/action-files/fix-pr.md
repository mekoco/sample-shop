I'll address the review comments on GitHub PR #${issue_number} by following these steps:

1. Fetch and analyze the PR details including review comments:
   - Run `gh pr view ${issue_number} --json title,body,comments,reviews,labels,assignees,state`
   - Review all review comments and requested changes
   - Identify specific issues raised by reviewers
2. Checkout the PR branch locally:
   - Run `gh pr checkout ${issue_number}`
   - Verify current branch with `git status`
3. Rebase the PR branch with latest master:
   - Fetch latest changes: `git fetch origin master`
   - Rebase onto master: `git rebase origin/master`
   - Resolve any merge conflicts if they arise
4. Analyze review feedback:
   - Group comments by type (bug fixes, style issues, logic changes, etc.)
   - Prioritize requested changes based on severity
   - Note any conflicting feedback that needs clarification
5. Document the review comments and planned fixes
6. Implement requested changes:
   - Address each review comment systematically

   - Ensure changes align with reviewer expectations
7. Test all changes:

   - Run frontend tests if applicable
   - Verify all tests pass without failures
8. Run lint and type checks:
   - Execute `npm run lint` and fix any issues
   - Execute `npm run typecheck` and resolve type errors
9. Deploy and test with containers if changes are significant:
   - Build containers: `docker compose build`
   - Run basic e2e tests: `cd frontend && npm run test:e2e:basic`
   - Check container logs for critical errors
10. Prepare changes for commit with a message that includes:
   - "Address PR review comments"
   - Brief summary of major changes made
   - Reference to specific reviewer feedback addressed
11. Push the updated branch: `git push --force-with-lease` (due to rebase)

    - Mark resolved conversations as resolved
    - Add explanatory comments where necessary
